<h2>About</h2>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Listy</strong> is a <em>responsive list slider</em>. 
</p>

<p>
This slider was made because I needed a slider which would slide a number of items, show only a number of items and change the number of shown and sliding items on resize/smaller device viewports.
You decide how the items will be styled and how will they behave on resize with CSS.

<h2>Usage</h2>
</div>
<p>It is really easy to set it. The slider calculates the width of the container by computing the number of items we want to show with the width of the list items (checks the first item in the list).</p>
